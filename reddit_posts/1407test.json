            "The following submission statement was provided by /u/F0urLeafCl0ver:\n\n---\n\nResearchers have published a study suggesting that space-based solar power (SBSP) panels could replace up to 80% of Europe's current terrestrial renewable energy capacity by 2050. Space-based solar panel arrays would avoid some of the problems associated with terrestrial solar, such as the variability in power output associated with changes in weather. The researchers who carried out the study suggest that SBSP is currently prohibitively expensive, but that technological advances may make it cost-effective by 2050. Japan has already begun to develop SBSP as part of its space and climate strategy. The authors of the study suggest that SBSP could play an important role in Europe's transition to renewable energy.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1mxe3hq/solar_panels_in_space_could_provide_80_of_europes/na48bx0/",
            ">Nor could the potential cost-effectiveness of SBSP be realised until 2050 because building, launching and maintaining it would be too expensive unless technological growth reduces its costs.\n\nWhat's with all those pie in the sky promises popping up? Is it meant to distract from more action to reduce emissions *now*?",

            "Why is the MAGA base so upset with Trump over the Epstein files? It’s a genuine question because he has said some really outrageous and outlandish things that the people believed without question (like Obama being a Muslim or having a fake birth certificate). So what’s changed now - Trump is saying there’s nothing significant in the files. As claims go it’s not particularly unbelievable - I mean if any president said “we investigated throughly and found no significant evidence. The files were just rumors and there’s no clear evidence that any of it is real” it’s pretty plausible right? Much more so than claiming another president’s birth certificate is a fake. \nSo why is the MAGA base having such a hard time buying this explanation?",

I didn’t think I was that out of the loop, but then one of them said something along the lines of “girl you are soo cunty” in like a positive tone and the others agreed? I was carrying a beer keg to the back so I didn’t stop to react but I just shook it off because I really don’t know what they meant by that.
