**ReelStudy** turns fandom into fluency. Learners consume real native content they already love—K‑POP clips, memes, Reddit threads, short reels—and practice English through a fast, swipe-based flow that feels like scrolling, not studying. The app delivers instant meanings, examples, and AI feedback in context, so motivation stays high and progress compounds.

**Problem it solves**
- After hitting test targets, many learners quit because study feels boring and disconnected from real life. Traditional apps focus on drills, not culture or community, so retention drops and “test English” doesn’t transfer to everyday use.
- ReelStudy solves the “post-exam drop-off” by anchoring study to intrinsic motivation (fandom) and live language use. It bridges the gap between scores and real-world fluency with engaging, contextual, native content and social learning.

**Real-life impact**
- Sustained retention: learning becomes a daily habit tied to users’ passions.  
- Practical fluency: users absorb up‑to‑date slang, idioms, and discourse patterns they actually meet online and abroad.  
- Community-powered confidence: learners interact with more proficient peers, ask questions, and co‑create knowledge—elevating persistence and outcomes.

**What we built (tech stack)**
- Frontend: iOS: Swift, Android: flutter 
- Content data: web crawling, Reddit's API, Naver dictionary API, YBM dictionary data
- Data/Analytics: GA4 + server events for CTR/CTA conversions, retention cohorts, and funnel tracking.  
- Infra: Vercel & V0(web)

**Future plans**
- Community features grounded in sociocultural learning and ZPD/Scaffolding:  
  - Topic hubs by fandom; comments and group chats to enable guided participation with more capable peers.  
  - Peer DM for sharing posts, phrases, and micro-lessons.  
  - Robust moderation: slang/abusive content filters, report/review workflows.  
- AI experiences  
  - AI tutor Q&A with retrieval over user history and saved phrases.  
  - Paraphrasing mode (Clean/Spicy) to compare formal vs. colloquial usage.  
  - Multimodal learning: video, images, text, and speech with on‑the‑fly captions, key‑phrase extraction, and shadowing scripts.  
- Progress intelligence  
  - Deeper proficiency modeling (CEFR‑like bands), word/phrase mastery ladders, and retention‑based review.  
  - Skill dashboards for vocabulary, listening, pragmatics, and discourse features.  
- Automation & scale  
  - Automated content ingestion/curation, continuous difficulty calibration, A/B testing ops, and creator/fandom partnerships.
