It doesn‚Äôt matter wether I‚Äôm in GA or seated; almost every concert I go to, there‚Äôs always some strong foul odor. The main ones I always smell are halitosis (bad breath), onion armpits, and dead animal.\n\nI get people like camping overnight to get into the venues early but why can‚Äôt we pack some toiletries and freshen up a bit? Why are we neglecting ourselves for people who don‚Äôt even know we exist?\n\n",

        "body": "The music industry as a whole is dark and ugly, but I have a particular hatred for the K-Pop industry. It‚Äôs a well-oiled machine. Young teens are groomed to perfection by these large entertainment companies with the sole purpose of making as much money as they can from their ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù. \n\nKids sign their lives away to these entertainment companies and are under strict control and supervision throughout their entire careers. They leave their families as young teens for training, with no guarantee to be a part of any group for years. And through all this, they are subjected to mental and physical abuse, which has pushed some k-pop artists to commit suicide. The pressures of the industry and the fans in South Korea are enormous, and Asia in general is on an entirely different level. \n\n",

All the details and ideas coming from the entertainment industry. It was also dark and disturbing. She admitted it left her with serious issues that it took years to overcome. And she was lucky enough to say no and get out after a time.",

The story of the season focuses on Fernando‚Äôs rise but doesn‚Äôt spend much time on the decline of the Ferrari as a car, instead making Michael and Ferrari a secondary story on the season. The Ferrari returned to front row competitiveness in 2006, so what on earth happened in 2005.",

            "Bridgestone didn‚Äôt adapt to that new rule anywhere near as well as Michelin, did which hurt Ferrari a lot as they were the biggest team running the Bridgestone thres.I think Ferrari also typically ran very aggressive tyre strategies in the previous few years, which wasn‚Äôt possible under that rule.\nOn top of all that, there were some changes to the aero regulations (the most notable being that the front wings had to be raised up) and I think that also impacted Ferrari a fair bit."

Having followed the sport for 40 odd years and spending a lifetime's fortune watching and reading it, I was getting to the point of jacking it all in.\nYet I watched this today, expecting another cynical Liberty money grab, and I was delightfully surprised. Sure, it's a movie and must be taken as such. But it is a very good movie. The best I've seen this year, and I watch a hell of a lot of movies.",

It made fun of K-pop in such a loving way, if that makes sense. Like it embraced the cringe instead of being embarrassed. Really sweet and a good message about dealing with trauma and not hiding yourself."
